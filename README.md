1.1

Place in Data Files\MWSE\mods\HarderBarter\

Requires MWSE 2.1 beta https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip

Uses mwse to dynamically adjust merchant buy prices.
Price = Price / log(baseprice)
This means expensive items are much less valuable and cheap items are more or less the same price.

1.1 update fixes items less than 10 gold value being worthless

Requires MWSE-Lua

Licensing: use whenever, wherever, for anything

Thanks to: nullcascade for mwse
